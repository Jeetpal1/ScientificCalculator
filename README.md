# ScientificCalculator
 This Application can perform scientific calculations.  Why I made this project?  Ans: I am taking minor in Mathematics, and while studying courses, I use calculator most of the time.  * I realized that I may need more functionalities in a scientific calculator in order to be more productive. For example, a result with specific number of digits after decimal point etc. So, I made this project which can be modified by me according to my need. For example, if I am taking some Binary language course. I can add functionality to convert a number to different number form such as Binary, Hexadecimal, octal etc. Moreover, it was fun to make something useful:)
